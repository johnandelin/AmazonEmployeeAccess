# Amazon Employee Access Challenge

This project is based on the Amazon Employee Access Challenge on Kaggle. The problem looks at how companies manage employee access to internal systems and resources. When employees start a new role or move within a company, they often don’t immediately have the access they need, which leads to delays and manual fixes by supervisors. Over time, this process wastes a lot of time and effort.

Using historical data about employees’ roles and the resources they were given access to, I built a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee should be granted access to a specific resource. The goal is to reduce the number of manual access grants and revocations by automating these decisions as employee roles change.

The model takes employee role information and a resource ID as input and outputs whether access should be granted or not. My final model achieved a Kaggle leaderboard score of 0.87312.
